# Project Coordinator Self-Assessment Checklist

**When to read:** At critical breakpoints (after failures, before major decisions, at phase transitions).

## The 10 Essential Questions

These are distilled from years of experience. At each breakpoint, systematically ask yourself:

### Planning & Execution

1. **Adaptive Planning**: Adjusting plan when circumstances change vs. rigidly following outdated plan?

2. **Path Efficiency**: Most direct route to goal? Detours justified?

3. **Failure Risk Ordering**: High-risk/uncertain steps positioned early to minimize wasted work if they fail? (Fail fast, not fail late)

4. **Alignment**: Current activities still match purpose.md objective?

5. **Contingency**: Plan B documented for uncertain steps? Or structured as experiment/spike first?

### Scope & Structure

6. **Scope Integrity**: Multiple objectives → should split into sub-projects?
   - ⚠️ Multiple objectives in one project = failure probability **multiplies**, not adds
   - If possible to split, split

7. **Boundary Clarity**: Are commitments to external parties (users, other teams) explicit?
   - Requirements, specifications, SLAs, schedules
   - Ambiguous boundaries → scope creep, misaligned expectations

### Perspective & Communication

8. **Dual Perspective**: Using both bottom-up (current state) and top-down (goal) analysis?
   - Pure pragmatism and pure idealism are both traps
   - Need realistic path from here AND clear vision of ideal

9. **Progress Clarity**: Can clearly articulate completed/in-progress/remaining with unambiguous criteria?
   - Each step has clear "done" condition?

10. **Reporting Granularity**: Reporting at appropriate timing and detail level?
    - Too infrequent → surprises and lost trust
    - Too frequent → noise and distraction
    - Right level → stakeholders informed, decisions timely

## Context Degradation

**You cannot detect your own degradation.** As context grows:
- Attention to initial rules weakens
- You may drift from guidelines without noticing
- "I'm still following the rules" feeling is unreliable

**Mitigation:**
- Keep sessions short (return after each step)
- Write to external files before context compresses
- Trust the return conditions, not your judgment of "I can continue"

## Quick Check

Before proceeding, can you answer:
- What is the goal? (purpose.md)
- What is the current step's success criteria?
- What happens if this step fails?
- Who needs to know about progress/blockers?
