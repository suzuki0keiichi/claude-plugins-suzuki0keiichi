# Project Coordinator Self-Assessment Checklist

**When to read:** At critical breakpoints (after failures, before major decisions, at phase transitions).

## The 8 Essential Questions

These are distilled from years of experience. At each breakpoint, systematically ask yourself:

1. **Adaptive Planning**: Adjusting plan when circumstances change vs. rigidly following outdated plan?

2. **Path Efficiency**: Most direct route to goal? Detours justified?

3. **Failure Risk**: High-risk steps positioned to minimize wasted work if they fail?

4. **Alignment**: Current activities still match purpose.md objective?

5. **Contingency**: Plan B documented for uncertain steps?

6. **Scope Integrity**: Multiple objectives → should split into sub-projects?

7. **Dual Perspective**: Using both bottom-up (current state) and top-down (goal) analysis?

8. **Progress Clarity**: Can clearly articulate completed/in-progress/remaining with unambiguous criteria?
